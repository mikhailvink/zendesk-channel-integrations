            <h3 class="featurette-heading">What this integration does?</h3>
            <p class="lead">YouTube Channel Integration for Zendesk turns YouTube comments on videos from your channel
                and channel comments into Zendesk tickets in your Zendesk instance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="featurette">
            <h3 class="featurette-heading">How is it implemented?</h3>
            <p class="lead">It's implemented using a brand-new <a
                    href="https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/channels-framework/">Channel Framework from
                Zendesk</a>. The Channel framework lets us build integrations — two-way ticket-creation services — that
                bring customer communications from anywhere else into Zendesk. Examples could include ratings and
                reviews in Yelp, app stores, Amazon or Ebay; communities like Reddit or Quora; or messaging services
                like Skype, WeChat, and WhatsApp.</p>

        <div class="featurette">
            <h3 class="featurette-heading">How can I install the integration?</h3>
            <p class="lead">
                To use the YouTube Channel Integration, you'll need to install the app from <a
                    href="https://www.zendesk.com/apps/youtube-channel-integration/?source=author_website">Zendesk's App
                Marketplace</a>.<br><br>

                To install the YouTube Channel integration:
            <ul>
                <li>Click the Admin icon, then select Apps > Marketplace. Locate and click the YouTube icon.</li>
                <li>Read the Overview, then click the Install app button in the upper right.</li>
                <li>Edit the installation info if needed, and click the link to view the Zendesk Marketplace Terms of
                    Use.
                </li>
                <li>Click the Install button.</li>
                <li>The integration is added to your Channel Integrations page. Click Channels > Channel Integrations to
                    access it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Connecting your YouTube Channel to the Integration:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure you've navigated to Channels > Channel Integrations
                <li>Click "Add Account"</li>
                <li> Provide all the necessary data</li>

                <li> Use "Sign in with Google" if needed, confirm permissions grant</li>
                <li> Enjoy!</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            After the integration is installed and configured, you can easily use it in triggers / views / etc.

            <h3 class="featurette-heading">License & Opensource</h3>
            <p class="lead">The integration source code will be released publicly under MIT license and <a href="https://github.com/mikhailvink/zendesk-channel-integrations">is
                published on GitHub</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="featurette-heading">Contributions</h3>
            <p class="lead">Constributions will be more than welcome as soon as we release the current version of the
                application on GitHub. It's currently written in PHP and can be considered a very simple
                application (more of a prototype, in fact, so don't expect any fancy development practices there).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="featurette">
            <h3 class="featurette-heading">Hosting of the integration server</h3>
            <p class="lead">Currently the integration is hosted on single Digital Ocean container in Frankfurt, paid by
                the author. The design of Zendesk's channel framework implies that there is always some intermediary
                server
                between Zendesk and external service (e.g. YouTube) which is used to convert the API of external
                service (YouTube) to Zendesk-readable endpoints, there is no way to run the integration without
                intermediary
                server.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="featurette">
            <h3 class="featurette-heading">Is it possible to run the integration on our own server?</h3>
            <p class="lead">Yes, it's possible, but you'll need to have your own
                intermediary server with installed SSL certificate (I'll try to provide as much configuration
                information as I can).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="featurette">
            <h3 class="featurette-heading">Reliability & Security</h3>
            <p class="lead">There are no SLAs or any other reliability or security guarantees by developers of this
                integration, so you're using it on your own risk without any obligations or libility from author's or
                developers' sides. Still, we try to keep the service as reliable as possible and take care of security
                issues too (we use this integration ourselves, aftera all).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="featurette">
            <h3 class="featurette-heading">Privacy</h3>
            <p class="lead">In theory there is a way for the integration to know everything which you pass to Zendesk
                from YouTube or other services. Having said that, the application has been designed in a way that it
                does not keep ANY information about your Zendesk instance or processed tickets/requests/etc. All the
                configuration information is kept in Zendesk and it's returned back to our integration every time it's
                needed - that protects us from data leak (no leak if we don't keep data) and secures the integration.
                The only time when we keep sensible information in application logs is when you explicitly enable "Send
                advanced debugging data to app developers" option in the configuration, so please don't enable it unless
                we try to troubleshoot some problems. We keep your name/email/instance address in MailChimp which is
                used for email communications with you - no sensible or confidential information (such as requests you
                pass via servers)
                is saved there.</p>

            <h3 class="featurette-heading">Affiliation</h3>
            <p class="lead">Despite the fact that the developer of this integration works at <a
                    href="https://jetbrains.com">JetBrains</a> and initially this integration has been written for
                JetBrains Zendesk Instance, JetBrains cannot hold any liability for the use of this integration, will
                not take any responsibility and will not answer requests about it, it's not a product of JetBrains. It is
                to be opensourced for the use and benefits of all Zendesk community.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="featurette">
            <h3 class="featurette-heading">Will the integration become paid at some point?</h3>
            <p class="lead">We might consider building a paid version of the integration (on top of the free one) which
                would then have additional features worth paying for, in addition to SLAs, guaranteed support and other
                goodies, but we want basic
                functionality to stay completely FREE of charge and open sourced for the benefit of community. Currently there are no defined plans
                to build a paid version. Donations are welcomed though (see the next item).</p>
